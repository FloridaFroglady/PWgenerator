# PWgenerator

## Notes about the project
This is homework for the UCF web development class. The html and css files were provided. 
The only original work is in the javascript file.  I did have a tutor help me with the syntax, but the logic is mine.
The comments are my actual pseudocode written as I outlined how to accomplish the tasks in the exercise and edited for clarity later.
The tutor assisted me in using .join() to achieve a password of the desired length instead of just one character from each type.
She also condensed some of my logic from multiple into single lines and suggested an array be used for the password instead of a string.

## Functionality
This application should take input from the user to generate a random password from 8-128 characters in length. 
It should prompt the user for the desired length and type of characters (lowercase, uppercase, special, numbers). 
It should then display the generated password in the box on the page. 
It should check that the input for length is between 8 and 128 and that at least one character type was chosen.
